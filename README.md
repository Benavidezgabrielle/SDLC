# SDLC
Software Development Lifecycle CS 250
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Creating user stories is an essential part of SDLC, as this usually occurs during the analysis of the program. The product owner will meet with the users to create the user stories which involves what requirements are needed of the program. As the product owner will see fit which of the user stories are a priority and then create a backlog for the scrum team for them to track the progress of product. We also recieve feedback from stakeholders via survey which helps determine how to implement the uer stoires within the product.



How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

In my opinion, agile method is superior to the waterfall method when being faced with a larger product. As the agile method is more flexible than the waterfall method that has a longer process where it is a phase by phase process. The agile method allows the team to work on different steps in the process without having to wait for all the steps to be completed. 


What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Being a good team in software development is having transparency and helping out the team even if it is not in your description. It also means understanding the project and researching and asking questions when something is not understood. Also, being active in the daily scrum meeting and listening ad asking questions to clarify what is not understood.
